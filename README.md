Recover Dead Battery using 555 Timer IC



Can recover dead sulfated batteries back to its full capaticy as you may know the lead acid battery actually consists of lead plates that is immersed in the electrolyte of diluted sulfuric acid so the charging and discharging of lead acid battery is actually oxidation and reduction process in thi chemical reaction the lead sulfate has driven and back in the electrolyte and over time with many cycles of charging and discharging the sulfates get permanently attached to the leaf plates reduces attached to the leaf plates that reduces its ability to hold to enough current and thatâ€™s when you see your battery with decreased performance or eventually stopped working to protect or recover the battery from this situation a battery needs to be connected or charged with high amplitude pulses generator which will disulfate the Reed plates and dissolves sulfates back into electrolyte I designed the simple circuit diagram and used triple 5 lifetime icy with some other components to generate the high amplitude pulses and with p-channel mosfet to send these pulses to same power source of the circuit then then I converted the circuit diagram to PCB.



IRF9Z34N



Fifth Generation HEXFETs from International Rectifierutilize advanced processing techniques to achieveextremely low   on-resistance per silicon area.   Thisbenefit, combined with the fast switching speed andruggedized device design that HEXFET PowerMOSFETs are well known for, provides the designerwith an extremely efficient and reliable device for usein a wide variety of applications.The TO-220 package is universally preferred for allcommercial-industrial applications at power dissipationlevels to approximately 50 watts.   The low thermalresistance and low package cost of the TO-220contribute to its wide acceptance throughout theindustry
